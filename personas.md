# What is this?

**Fictional** vignettes of participants and contributors to better guide the project objectives and build the community.

*Note that for the sake of the vignettes, I'm using atomic element names and the corresponding abbreviations in place of any gendered pronouns.*

# Students

*Hydrogen* is a PhD student in marine biology with a background (undergrad major) in biology. H has taken the standard math curriculum for biology majors as well as classes in biometry. H's previous research experience is in a wet-lab, doing non-computational work. H has started collecting data for H's thesis projects, following standard experimental designs, using physical logbooks.

H is interested in knowing how to digitize data in a standard format so that other people can use it after publication, in addition to doing analysis for H's thesis papers. H is also curious about using other people's data for meta-analyses and review papers.

*Helium* is a PhD student in marine ecology (or, as it is called at SIO, biological oceanography) with a background (undergrad major) in ecology. He has taken the standard math curriculum for ecology majors as well as classes in experimental design, programming, and data analysis. He's previous research experience has been collecting field data, data entry, and basic statistical analyses in Excel and SPSS. He has started collecting data for He's thesis projects, in the form of digitized output from instruments and physical logbooks.

He is interested in organizing data, in a programmatic way, to save work on processing data on subsequent occasions. He is also interested in developing He's analysis code so that it can be reused by collaborators and other researchers.

*Lithium* is a PhD student in neuroscience with a background (undergrad major) in biology and computer science. Li has taken many classes in programming and biology. Li has significant experience collecting data from instruments and writing code to produce analyses for research.

Li is interested in writing software packages for Li's analysis code for other people to use (citing Li in the process)! Li would also like to use version control to better keep track of bugs and features as they are encountered by users.

# Local Practitioners

*Beryllium* is a postdoc with training in data analysis and programming. Be has worked on previous projects where collaborators have shared data and code. Be has also used Git and Github for personal projects, and has contributed to some open source software in the post. Be is interested in developing better practices for Be's own research, learning how to train others, and having entire research papers be open and reproducible by anyone.

*Boron* is a librarian familiar with data archival, programming, and open source projects. B is a software carpentry-trained instructor and has led projects before. B would like to see more adoption of open science principles by campus researchers and is interested in using the library resources to support such efforts.

# External Experts

*Carbon* is a program manager at a funding agency interested in obtaining the best value for funding \$\$. C is aware that some scientists use preprints to disseminate research results more quickly and that some scientists also share data and code online. C would like to encourage funded researchers to use these technologies better and to help with outreach to the public, possible donors. C would also like to network researchers working on similar projects to leverage each other's strengths.

*Nitrogen* is an open-source developer, who has been using tools such as Git and Github for many years as part of N's job. N spends time collaborating on several different open-source coding projects, some of which are used by academic researchers. N is familiar with best practices in the development community, including documentation, collaborating on small and large projects, and bug-tracking. N would like others to know how to navigate GitHub and better be able to contribute to projects.
