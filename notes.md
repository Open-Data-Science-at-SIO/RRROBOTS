1. Make our work reproducible for ourselves - a necessary but not sufficient test for correctness.
2. Make our work reproducible for others - easier peer review, easier for other people to collaborate, contribute, extend your work (higher impact), transparency as accountability

## Version Control (Git & GitHub)

Why would we use them?


Git

capture process
- subjective decisions
- sometimes mistakes, but important for reproduction
- explicit note-taking allows robustness tests post-hoc, alternative analyses, "multiverse" testing (a la Gelman)
