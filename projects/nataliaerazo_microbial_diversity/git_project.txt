Readme 

I will be reproducing a paper that developed a a new pipeline to determine microbial community structure by examining metabolic pathways. I will look at different databases: TARA, Human microbiome, Earth microbiome . I will replicate the method with different datasets and I will also compared it to other metrics for community structure: alpha and beta diversity.
