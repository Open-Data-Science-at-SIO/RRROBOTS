# Reproducible Research in R for Ocean Biosciences: Open-science Training Seminar

## Course Objectives

The goal of this course is to familiarize students with the process of applying statistical data analysis as part of the scientific research process. At the completion of the course, students will have first-hand experience for the entire data analysis workflow, from processing raw datasets to generating figures and interpreting them in a scientific context suitable for publication.

Students will work in small groups to replicate the analysis of a (recent) publication. Time permitting, they will then develop their own scientific questions to be applied to the same data. Students will gain experience and training in the usage of technology for effective collaboration, open science, and reproducible research, including skills such as: data management, version control, and literate programming.

See [Roadmap](https://github.com/Open-Data-Science-at-SIO/RRROBOTS/issues/2)

## Code of Conduct

All participants will be expected to follow the SIO Open Data Science Code of Conduct: https://open-data-science-at-sio.github.io/mission.html

Note that this applies both to the physical space for classes, as well as online interactions in the chatroom, mailing list, and Github repository.

## Target Audience

This course is aimed at students in the MB and BO programs who are thinking about or currently engaged in analyzing data for their own dissertation (i.e. ~3rd years and above), and who have at taken at least 1 programming course and 1 statistics course. Students who are interested in the course, but unsure about their background in statistics or programming should contact the instructor before registering.

Space is limited to 10 students.

### Pre-requisites

Students who plan to attend should install Git (https://git-scm.com/) and create a Github account (https://github.com/).

Students are encouraged to install and use R (https://cran.r-project.org/), RStudio (https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/) to ensure a standard user interface. While students may use Python and Jupyter notebooks if desired, I am not able to assist with set-up and troubleshooting of either.

## Logistics

Meetings will take place every Tuesday, from 3pm to 5pm in Vaughan Hall 328.
The first session will be April 4, 2017 with the last one occurring on June 6, 2017.

In addition, lab/office hours will be offered every Friday (April 7 to June 2), from 3pm to 5pm in Vaughan Hall 328. The goal of these sessions is to provide a formal time for producing the data analysis as well as to resolve any coding issues that may have arisen in the prior Tuesday's meeting.

### Schedule
