## Guidelines for Contributing

Thanks for checking out our project! If you haven't already, please check out the [readme](https://github.com/Open-Data-Science-at-SIO/RRROBOTS/blob/master/README.md) for general info about what we're doing.

### Code of Conduct
As referenced in the README, participation in this project is governed by the SIO Open Data Science Code of Conduct: https://open-data-science-at-sio.github.io/mission.html

### For the General Public
If you're not a course participant, we ask that you use one of the following two methods for contributing:

1. Create an issue -- if you spot any typos, bugs, or have general suggestions, etc. You can also use this to participate in ongoing discussions. For more info, please check out this Github [guide](https://guides.github.com/features/issues/).

2. Fork and create a pull request -- if you have changes that you'd like to see added to the course materials. For more info, please check out this Github [guide](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/).

### For Course Participants
If you are a course participant:

1. Use Github issues (as described above) to manage your reproduction.

2. Create a branch to keep track of your commits separately. Once you've made sufficient progress, you should issue a pull request to merge with master. You can do this in order to report on progress or ask for help on issues. For more info, please check out this [guide](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Branching-Basic-Branching-and-Merging).
