# Week 1 Catchup

---

# GitHub

### What is it?
* An online service to store your Repos.

  - like a shared Dropbox folder that you manually sync to
  
--

* A project management tool.

  - Create / discuss / assign / resolve **issues**
  
  - Manage repos / releases / etc.

--

* A website hosting platform

  - GitHub pages (see https://pages.github.com/ for more details)

---

# GitHub Demo

### Setup access on GitHub

* What is your GitHub account name?

### Check git config

* http://happygitwithr.com/hello-git.html

### Setup ssh key

* http://happygitwithr.com/ssh-keys.html

---

# GitHub workflow

### Update the course repo

* make a new branch
* make changes

# Reproducibility

---
class: center, middle

# *Your most frequent collaborator is your former self... and that person doesn't respond to emails*

# What does reproducibility mean?

### Every step of the analysis can be reproduced independently

---

# How do we make our work reproducible?

* Avoid manual data manipulation
  - use scripts to process raw data
  
* Track results and how they were produced
  - version control (e.g. Git)
  - intermediate results
  - summary datasets and code for figures
  - random number seeds (e.g. for some model-fitting algorithms)
  
* Keep documentation close to the underlying code
  - adopt "good"" coding practices

* Make code and data available
  - GitHub, data/code archiving services
