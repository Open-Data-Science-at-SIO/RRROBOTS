# Week 1 Catchup

---

# GitHub

### What is it?
* An online service to store your Repos.

  - like a shared Dropbox folder that you manually sync to
  
--

* A project management tool.

  - Create / discuss / assign / resolve **issues**
  
  - Manage repos / releases / etc.

--

* A website hosting platform

  - GitHub pages (see https://pages.github.com/ for more details)

---

# GitHub Demo

### Setup access on GitHub

* What is your GitHub account name?

### Check git config

* http://happygitwithr.com/hello-git.html

### Setup ssh key

* http://happygitwithr.com/ssh-keys.html

---

# GitHub workflow

### Update the course repo

* make a new branch
* make changes
* commit changes
* push upstream
* send pull request

# Reproducibility

---
class: center, middle

# *Your most frequent collaborator is your former self... and that person doesn't respond to emails*

---

# What does reproducibility mean?

### Every step of the analysis can be reproduced independently

---

# How do we make our work reproducible?

* Avoid manual data manipulation
  - use scripts to process raw data
  
* Track results and how they were produced
  - version control (e.g. Git)
  - intermediate results
  - summary datasets and code for figures
  - random number seeds (e.g. for some model-fitting algorithms)
  
* Keep documentation close to the underlying code
  - adopt "good"" coding practices

* Make code and data available
  - GitHub, data/code archiving services

# Project/File Organization

---

# Philosophy

### Make your projects navigable
* find what you need quickly

### Develop good (but flexible) habits
* find out what works for you
* don't be afraid to experiment (version control is your friend!)

### Consistency
* for yourself and for others

---

# General Guidelines

* Include a README for all projects
  - "is this the project I'm looking for?"

* Include a LICENSE for all projects
  - "how can I use this project?"

* Organize sub-folders
  - `data`, `results`, `figures`
  - `doc` (reference material and documentation)
  - `bin` (compiled executables)
  - `paper` (manuscript files)
  
* Pick informative names
  - use alphabetical file sorting to order and group files
  
     (e.g. "yyyy-mm-dd" data formats)

# Philosophy

### Don't modify the raw data!
* use scripts to correct errors (programmatically or manually)

### Avoid duplication of data
* information can become desynchronized
* use data structures / standards for your field

  (or whatever works best for your projects)

### Write functions for each pipeline step

---

# Why write functions?

* Documentation
  - easier to translate into "methods" section

* Debugging & Error-checking
  - verify using known working inputs and outputs
  - simpler to **refactor**

* Reproducibility
  - explicit control over inputs and outputs

* Reusability
  - in R, functions can be collected in packages and shared

---

# Data Formats

### No one-size fits all solution!

### Tidy Data (one generally-applicable standard)

* a dataset is arranged by rows and columns
* each **column** is a variable
  - "A variable contains all values that measure the same underlying attribute (like height, temperature, duration) across units."
* each **row** is an observation
  - "An observation contains all values measured on the same unit (like a person, or a day, or a race) across attributes."

* NOTE: Within a single dataset, **variables** and **observations** may change depending on analysis!
