# What is Git?

**Git** is software for version control...
--

with a ~~bad~~ terrible user interface.

--

### What is it supposed to do?

* track changes to your project
* facilitate experimentation
* enable collaborations

--

*It actually is pretty good at these things, which is why people put up with it.*

---

# Lesson Objectives

### Tasks
* track changes to your project
* time travel
* facilitate experimentation
* enable collaborations
* project management

### Definitions
* **Git** is software that lives on your computer.
* **GitHub** is a website that acts as a remote backup
  - like Dropbox or Google Drive

---

# Recording History

### Projects reside in a folder.

* A **repository** (or **repo**) contains the history of a project.

--

### You use Git to take snapshots of all the files in a folder.
* A **commit** corresponds to a single snapshot.

--

### Each commit records **metadata**
* Who & when
* What (commit message)
* Where the commit came from (its history)
* Labels (branch names)

# Time Travel

### Git stores a log of past commits
* This is why commit messages are important

--

### Each commit has a unique id
* This enables reversion to previous project versions

--

### We can load previous commits
* In Git, this is the **checkout** command

# DEMO

---

# Experimentation

### Commits are immutable
* We can't lose work *if it is committed*

--

### Sometimes we need to experiment without disrupting history
* Git enables this using **branches**

--

### Branches
* A branch is actually just a label attached to a commit that automatically progresses.
* The default branch name is **master**.

---

# Collaboration

### Workflow

* It is common for master to hold a clean copy of the project (i.e. the code runs and everything works).
* Work is done by individuals or groups in separate branches.
* Changes that are ready to be deployed are then **merged** into master.

### Merge Conflicts

* If changes have occurred to the same location of the same file, Git will inform you of a conflict.
* Fix this by resolving changes manually, and make a new commit.

# Remote Backups

### Copying repos
* Git is meant as a *distributed* model: each copy of the repo has the full history.
* Other computers with the same repo are **remotes**
* Copying Git repos is known as **cloning**

### Synchronizing
* Sending commits to other computers is **pushing**
* Grabbing commits from other computers is **pulling**

# Collaborations

### Git hosting
* GitHub is a popular service for hosting Git repos
* public repos are free, private ones available for $$ or edu accounts

### GitHub features
* basic text editing on the website
* track issues
* send pull requests (e.g. ask someone to pull/merge changes into master)
* showcase your projects
* write documentation

# DEMO

# TODO

### Make sure Git and GitHub work on your computer
* test Git
* test syncing with GitHub
* send me your GitHub account info to be added to the course repo

### Decide on groups and papers
* find a partner (optional), preferably mix of programming/stats skill
* choose a paper to reproduce (either from list or de novo)
